/**
 * pt-i18n
 * Initialize i18n for the library.
 *
 * Libraries have to be initialized just like applications, see
 * GLib Reference Manual → GLib Utilities → Internationalization
 *
 * This is called from pt_player_new() and also from pt_waveloader_new()
 * because PtWaveloader can be used without a PtPlayer. All other objects
 * with translations are run after creating either a PtPlayer or PtWaveloader
 * and don’t need this call anymore.
 *
 * “Inspired” by totem-pl-parser.c: totem_pl_parser_init_i18n().
