<title>Timestamps</title>

<p>Timestamps help you to navigate in your transcription.</p>

<note>
<p>Timestamps can look like this: #03:45.2#. You can select them with or without the number signs.</p>
</note>

<p><app>Parlatype</app> can produce different timestamp formats, they can be set in <link xref="preferences#timestamps" />.</p>

<title>Drag and drop</title>

<p>If you select the timestamp in the word processor, you can drag and drop it on the <app>Parlatype</app> window and it will go to that position. This is also possible the other way round: Drag the time label from <app>Parlatype</app> to a word processor and drop it there to insert it.</p>

<title>Using the clipboard</title>

<p>Clicking on the menu button that is showing the current time you can <gui>Copy Time to Clipboard</gui> or <gui>Go to Time in Clipboard</gui>.</p>

<p>This can also be done with keyboard shortcuts. First make sure, the <app>Parlatype</app> window has focus. With the key sequence <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>c</key></keyseq> the current timestamp is copied to the clipboard. Changing to the word processor you can insert now the timestamp in your transcription.</p>
<p>To go to a timestamp position, copy the timestamp in the word processor to the clipboard. Once you have changed focus to <app>Parlatype</app> press <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>v</key></keyseq>.</p>
