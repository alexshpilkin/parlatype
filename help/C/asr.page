<title>Automatic Speech Recognition</title>

<p><app>Parlatype</app> offers automatic speech recognition that is done on
your computer. No data is sent over the network.</p>

<note><p><app>Parlatype</app> must have been built with <app>PocketSphinx</app>
or <app>Mozilla DeepSpeech</app>.
Please note that those libraries might be not available on your platform.
</p></note>

<note><p><app>Parlatype</app> has no built-in text editor. You need the
Parlatype Extension for <app>LibreOffice</app> to output recognized text.

<title>Start Speech Recognition</title>

<p>Select a language model in the Preferences Dialog,
<gui>Speech Recognition</gui> tab, see <link xref="asr-setup" /> for more details.</p>

<p>Open the primary menu and click on <gui>Automatic Transcription</gui>.
This is only available, if you have setup and chosen a language model.</p>

<media its:translate="no" type="image" src="figures/asr-switch-to-asr.png"/>

<p>Now press <gui>Play</gui> in <app>Parlatype</app> and the recognized speech
will be printed in <app>LibreOffice</app>, if the Parlatype Extension is
installed. Output is silent because decoding speed is dependent on your machine
and may be slower or faster than real-time speech.</p>

<p>Output is without punctuation or capitalization, you have to add or correct that yourself.</p>

<note><p><em>Accuracy</em> depends on many factors like quality of the
recording, background noise, speakerâ€™s dialect or pronunciation and the speech
model used. For general transcription you can expect an word error rate between
10 and 50 %. Alas this means that in some cases manual transcription from the
start will be faster than automatic transcription and the following correction process.</p></note>
